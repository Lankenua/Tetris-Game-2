I had created a simple Tetris game using Python and Pygame as my second project for the Athena Awards. 
I couldn't create a playable link so I began afresh and made a JS code to allow it deploy. This has been challenging but a learning experience. 
Blocks fall and can be moved by the player using arrows key. 
I had done initially 8hours in the first submission and later in recreating I did 3hours 24mins. 
I will indicate 11hours below. (Indicated this just to explain so that it doesn't seem like time fraud)   :)
